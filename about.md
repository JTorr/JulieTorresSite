# Meet Julie
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/julie_xs.jpg){: .align-right}

Julie took the long road to software development. After majoring in Spanish and
International Business at Georgia State University, she fell into the first
career that would have her, which turned out to be retail banking management.

Julie loves to learn, and, on a lark, decided to teach herself a bit of code.
She was immediately hooked. Within a year, she had taught herself the basics of
Ruby on Rails, graduated from a coding bootcamp, and secured her first job in software
development.

She is now a full stack developer, and currently works in React.js.

Julie has been married "figuratively" forever to her high school sweetheart,
Donnie. She has 2 munchkins, named Cece and Daniel. She is raising them geeky,
and they enjoy explosive science experiments as a family.
Julie is also obsessed with books, and has a special
fascination with behavioral economics.
